"FancyChocolateShop2" is a "complete" deluxe chocolate shop. Start the Jave maven project, along with the javascript project (at resources/static/js), go to http://localhost:8080 and you'll be presented with a website hosting the chocolate shop.

Either make a new account, log in as a user (existing username: Alice, Password: Alice123) or log in as Admin (username: Admin, password: Password).
And you'll be able to make purchases with the money available in your account. Orders, new accounts and history will be saved in the H2-database on the server computer.
Admin accounts are able to see purchases from all other accounts.

This is the group project that I and 2 others did during our backend course at Nackademin.
The frontend is written in Javascript with some jQuery, the backend is made with Java Spring boot to create a REST API, along with the Hibernate framework to provide a relational database.
It was made during my first year as a student and could definitely have been written a lot better,
but considering our skill at the time I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.
