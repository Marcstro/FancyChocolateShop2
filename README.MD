This is the group project that I and 2 others did during our backend course at Nackademin.
The frontend is written in Javascript with some jQuery, the backend is made with Java Spring to create a REST API, along with the Hibernate framework to provide a relational database.
It was made during my first year as a student and could definitely have been written a lot better,
but considering our skill at the time I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.
