This is the group project I and 2 others did during our backend course at Nackademin.
The frontend is written in Javascript, the backend in Java Spring boot.
It was made during my first year as a student and could definitely have been written a lot better,
but considering our skill at the time I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.
